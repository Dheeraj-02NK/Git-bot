Spread Distribution\n\nUpon analyzing the distribution of the average spread, it was observed that the spread varies significantly across different agricultural products. Some products exhibit higher average spreads, indicating greater price variability.\n\n## 5. Time Series Analysis\n\nA time series analysis was performed to understand how the average spread has changed over time. It was found that certain products experienced fluctuations in spread, suggesting potential seasonal trends or external factors influencing pricing.\n\n## 6. Correlation Analysis\n\nA correlation matrix revealed interesting relationships between variables. Notably, the farm price showed a positive correlation with the average spread. Further investigation into this relationship could provide insights into pricing dynamics.\n\n## 7. Regional Price Variations\n\nRetail prices in different cities exhibited variations, with certain cities consistently having higher or lower prices across multiple products. Understanding these regional variations could be crucial for market analysis and decision-making.\n\n## 8. Outliers and Anomalies\n\nIdentification of outliers and anomalies in farm prices, retail prices, or average spread was essential. These data points could provide valuable insights into exceptional market conditions or errors in data collection.\n\n## 9. Impact of Specific Products\n\nAnalyzing the impact of specific products on the overall spread distribution could help identify key drivers in the agricultural market. Some products might contribute more significantly to price fluctuations than others.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nBased on the EDA findings, the following recommendations are suggested:\n\n- Conduct further investigation into the positive correlation between farm prices and average spread to uncover underlying factors.\n- Explore the reasons behind the observed regional variations in retail prices and assess their impact on overall market dynamics.\n- Consider deeper analysis of time series trends, especially for products with significant spread fluctuations, to uncover potential seasonality or external influences.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe EDA provided valuable insights into the dataset, laying the groundwork for more in-depth analyses. The identified patterns and relationships will guide further exploration and contribute to a better understanding of the agricultural market dynamics.\n","metadata":{}}]}
